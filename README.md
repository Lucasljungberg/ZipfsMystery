Gathering words and storing them to test Zipfs Mystery

The idea of the experiment is to test how well Zipfs Mystery works, just for fun really. The theory says that, eg for word usage, the *n*th most used worth will be used about 1/*n* compared to that of the most frequently used word. So this script simply gathers words from a forum (reddit) and checks its frequency.
